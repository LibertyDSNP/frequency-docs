## The Problem

Social networking has wholly transformed digital communication for the modern age.
Unfortunately, the social networking industry is currently dominated by a handful of global private companies growing rich off the data of their users.
These data repositories, that were ceaselessly mined for significant user insights, ultimately grew into a web of manipulation, exploitation, and polarization.
The evolution of these secretive agencies made clear that the social infrastructure needed to change and return agency back to the users.

Yet there are significant challenges when blockchain technology is applied to the high-volume, low-value transactions associated with a social network, as the cost can quickly overwhelm business models.

## The Solution

Frequency is a Layer 1 blockchain designed around a novel economic system that uses three interconnected models: the Delegation Model, the Capacity Staking Model, and the Data Transaction Model, to meet and carefully balance the necessary criteria. This blockchain is available for multiple use casesâ€”including non-financial, high-volume, broadcast-based ones like social media. Frequency builds on blockchain technology to enable users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data.
The first use case for Frequency is with the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol, an open, web3 protocol for ethical, economical, and scalable decentralized social media applications.

## Scalability

Frequency changes the unit economics of blockchain transactions to leverage a network scale suitable for a new range of massively scaled decentralized apps and services.  Frequency addresses scalability via The Frequency Triangle--a unique combination of three unique economic models with manual and automatic balance mechanisms in a novel ecosystem that can support blockchain applications that are both economical and ethical at scale.  Frequency's three economic models include:The Delegation Model, The Capacity Staking Model, and The Data Transaction Model. The Frequency blockchain is like a 3-legged stool. Without any one of the three economic model solutions, balance is lost, and the stool can no longer stand. Not only must all three of these models be present, but they must also be carefully balanced with one another, otherwise the stool will wobble, and the ecosystem will not thrive. Thus, each model has manual and automatic mechanisms that may be used to restore the system to a balanced state.
