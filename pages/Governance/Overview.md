# Frequency Governance

Frequency regards democratic governance as the primary action plan, partially to adjust governance parameters according to its own business needs, and to derive a governance model that is more adapted to the pace of its innovation.
Frequency will start with the basic governance mechanism of Polkadot as a whole: a tricameral governance structure, which is a relatively mature on-chain governance mechanism, that is, coordinated governance by three institutions: the Frequency Council, the Technical Committee, and token holder voting.
