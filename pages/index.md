# About Frequency

##  All is subject to change

Frequency is the first implementation of [The Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP)](https://www.dsnp.org/) operating as a Polkadot parachain.
Frequency delivers essential tooling to create a next generation of people-centric social networking apps that offer consumers more control and choice.
In other words, it enables users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data.
It provides scalable message passing as a backbone of new shared protocols that create value through cooperation and user choice.

Here you can find detailed documentation for Frequency, official implementation specifications, associated specifications, as well as a roadmap and proposals for future extensions.
