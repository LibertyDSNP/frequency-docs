# Collator Decentralization Roadmap

Frequency currently operates using "invulnerable" Collators.
These collators are not removed for lack of block production and do not require a stake or bond to operate.

Frequency aims to maintain network stability and operation while increasing decentralization and openness as quickly as possible.
To accomplish this, there are has three key phases:

1. Initialization: Select Organizations.
2. Expansion and Testing: Open Applications.
3. Public Collators: Anyone can register as a Collator candidate.

## Initialization (Current)

- Collators from select organizations.
- Organizations guarantee public transparency and access to all non-malicious transactions to the block.
- Organizations commit to keeping up with client updates to enable chain evolution.

## Expansion and Testing

- Collator applications will be open to anyone.
- Collators will form the foundation of the public Collator set.

This phase will test the incentivization as Frequency progresses to fully public Collators.

## Public Collators

- Collators are selected based on bond, governance support, and uptime that will be developed.
- Progression highly depends on the safety and security of the network.
