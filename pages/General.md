## The Problem

Social networking has wholly transformed digital communication for the modern age.
Unfortunately, the social networking industry is currently dominated by a handful of global private companies growing rich off the data of their users.
These data repositories, that were ceaselessly mined for significant user insights, ultimately grew into a web of manipulation, exploitation, and polarization.
The evolution of these secretive agencies made clear that the social infrastructure needed to change and return agency back to the users.

Yet there are significant challenges when blockchain technology is applied to the high-volume, low-value transactions associated with a social network, as the cost can quickly overwhelm business models.

## The Solution

Frequency builds on blockchain technology to enable users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data.
Frequency supports the [DSNP](https://dsnp.org) public social graph which completely disconnects financial incentivization from the social graph, establishing an essential foundation for the future of social networks.
Frequency changes the way blockchain transactions are financed and priced to leverage a network scale suitable for social networking.
This approach allows technology to be used cost-efficiently for a new range of high-frequency, massively scaled decentralized apps and services.

## Scalability

Building Frequency as a Polkadot parachain offers a solution to the challenge of scaling a social networking platform.
Polkadot's fixed price consensus combined with the Relay Chain and parachain infrastructures offer the capability to manage costs more effectively than other blockchain ecosystems.
Frequency addresses scalability with [Messages](./Basics/Messages.md) that can support [delegation](Basics/MessageSourceAccounts.md) and [batching](Basics/Messages.md#batching-vs-single-messages) that significantly reduce the number of transactions the main blockchain needs to verify and record, which in turn speeds up the processing time of the remaining transactions.
