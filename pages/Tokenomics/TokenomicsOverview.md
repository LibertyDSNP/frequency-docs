# Tokenomics

**Capacity is currently under development - more details will be released soon.**

The Frequency mainnet token is called FRQCY.
Frequency also utilizes [Capacity](#capacity), an alternative to using tokens to perform certain types of transactions.
See the [Capacity](Capacity.md) page for more detailed information.

The [Frequency Rococo Testnet](../Networks/Overview.md) token is notated as XRQCY - this token is only for testing and holds no value.

## Goals:

Frequency aims to accomplish two goals:

* **To establish different classes of transactions:** Prioritize data-focused transactions centered around creating and sourcing new data.
* **To become a force of democratization amongst a decentralized social network:** Distributing Capacity to users for delegation to Providers.

## FRQCY Token & Capacity

FRQCY is a utility token. Capacity is a non-transferable resource associated with an [MSA account](#2-message-source-account-msa).
Users can stake FRQCY tokens to generate Capacity through [Maximized Capacity Staking](#2-maximized-capacity-staking-for-applications-and-services) or [Rewards Capacity Staking](#1-rewards-capacity-staking-for-users).
Visit here for more information regarding the [Capacity Economic System](Capacity.md).

| Unit   | Decimal Places | Syntax        | Decimal FRQCY |
| -----  | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Planck | 0	   	      | 1/100 000 000 | 0.00000001    |
| Micro (uFRQCY) | 1    	| 1/1 000		  | 0.00000010    |
| Milli (mFRQCY) | 5   	   | 1/1 000		  | 0.00100000    |
| Unit (FRQCY)   | 8   	   | 1/1			  | 1.00000000    |
| Million (MFRQCY) | 14		| 1 000 000/1	  | 1 000 000.00  |

## Frequency Users and Democratization:

On the Frequency network, End Users do not need to access FRQCY tokens or Capacity to use the network.
There are a few primary users on the Frequency network broken into the categories below.

* **Frequency Providers:**
Applications and services that use the Capacity Economic system are called [Providers](#provider), and must have Capacity to serve the users that delegate to them.
While Capacity isn’t like other costs, Providers are not dictated how to pay for Frequency.

* **Coinless Users:**
People who don’t need tokens to interact with the blockchain.
They still have wallets with private keys but instead of managing tokens these keys enable them to maintain control of their information and identity on-chain.
While they may interact with tokens for other purposes, they are not required to.

* **Direct Frequency Users:**
Those who interact with the FRQCY token and are engaged in staking, governance, building new Schemas, or other systems on Frequency.
These users overlap with [DSNP users](https://spec.dsnp.org/).

## Frequency Incentives:
Frequency utilizes a limited incentive model to accomplish three things.
The goals and limited reach of each incentive provides a safeguard against misuse and allows for minor adjustments as consequences arise.

1. Encourage collaboration between Providers (Capacity)
2. Produce the value necessary to support itself (Collator Rewards)
3. Decentralize system control over time (Tokens)
