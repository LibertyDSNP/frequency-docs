## Work in Progress

# Introduction

Frequency is the first implementation of [The Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP)](https://www.dsnp.org/introducing-dsnp.html) operating as a Polkadot parachain. 
Frequency delivers essential tooling to create a next generation of people-centric social networking apps that offer consumers more control and choice. 
In other words, it enables users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data. 
It provides scalable message passing as a backbone of new shared protocols that create value through cooperation and user choice. 

Here you can find detailed documentation for Frequency, official implementation specifications, associated specifications, as well as a roadmap and proposals for future extensions.

## Core Ideas

Frequency aims to return agency to the user amongst an ecosystem of rampant misinformation, censorship from state and corporate actors, and near monopolies from select players with absolute power over social engagements. 
Frequency, as an implementation of DSNP, strives to solve these challenges by reshaping online social interactions through prioritizing: 

1. **Different Classes of Transactions**
	* Data Focused Transactions
 
2. **Broadcast as a Key to Decentralization**
	* Announcements and Metadata
	
3. **Different Economic Structure**
	* Capacity
	
4. **Collaborative Standardization**
	* Shared Schemas
 

## The Problem: 

Social networking has wholly transformed digital communication for the modern age. 
The industry has become dominated by a handful of global private companies, growing rich off the data of their users. 
These data repositories sparked significant user insights which soon grew into a web of manipulation, exploitation, and polarization. 
The evolution of these secretive agencies made clear that the social infrastructure needed to change and return agency back to the users. 

Yet when blockchain technology is applied to high-volume, low-value transactions associated with a social network, the cost quickly overwhelms business models. 

## The Solution:

The solution necessitates developing a new foundation and infrastructure to secure individual’s data rights and opens innovation beyond the current select few. 

The project originated with [Unfinished](https://www.unfinishedlabs.io/), a social impact organization with a network of partners engaged in technology, academia, social impact, and the arts. The first phase of work focused on delivering the social network as core internet functionality.  The Decentralized Social Network, DSNP serves as a public resource entirely independent of financial incentives. Frequency is the second strange of work and unlocks decentralized social networking at scale for the first time.

Frequency builds on blockchain technology to enable users to interact in a public digital space and retain agency over their data. 
A public social graph disconnects financial incentivization completely, establishing an essential foundation for the future of social networks. 
Frequency changes the way blockchain transactions are priced to leverage a network scale suitable for social networking. 
This approach allows technology to be cost-efficiently used for a new range of high-frequency, massive-scale decentralized apps and services.

## Scalability:

Building Frequency as a [Polkadot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started) parachain offers a solution to the challenge of scaling a social networking platform. 
Polkadot's fixed price consensus combined with the relay chain and parachain infrastructures offer capability to manage costs more effectively than other blockchain ecosystems. 

Frequency addresses scalability primarily through batching and delegation. 
These schemas significantly reduce the number of transactions the main blockchain needs to verify and record, which in turn speeds up the processing time of the remaining transactions.

## Financial Incentive Freedom for Applications on DSNP and Frequency: 

Removal of financial incentives is a key pillar of DSNP and Frequency’s implementation framework. 

Implementation elements for this concept are currently under development.
