<h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Frequency is the first implementation of <a href="https://www.dsnp.org/">The Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP)</a> operating as a Polkadot parachain. 
Frequency delivers essential tooling to create a next generation of people-centric social networking apps that offer consumers more control and choice. 
In other words, it enables users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data. 
It provides scalable message passing as a backbone of new shared protocols that create value through cooperation and user choice. </p>
<p>Here you can find detailed documentation for Frequency, official implementation specifications, associated specifications, as well as a roadmap and proposals for future extensions.</p>
<h2 id="core-ideas"><a class="header" href="#core-ideas">Core Ideas</a></h2>
<p>Frequency aims to return agency to the user amongst an ecosystem of rampant misinformation, censorship from state and corporate actors, and near monopolies from select players with absolute power over social engagements. 
Frequency, as an implementation of DSNP, strives to solve these challenges by reshaping online social interactions through prioritizing: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Different Classes of Transactions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data Focused Transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast as a Key to Decentralization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Announcements and Metadata</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Different Economic Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative Standardization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Schemas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a class="header" href="#the-problem">The Problem:</a></h2>
<p>Social networking has wholly transformed digital communication for the modern age. 
The industry has become dominated by a handful of global private companies, growing rich off the data of their users. 
These data repositories sparked significant user insights which soon grew into a web of manipulation, exploitation, and polarization. 
The evolution of these secretive agencies made clear that the social infrastructure needed to change and return agency back to the users. </p>
<p>Yet when blockchain technology is applied to high-volume, low-value transactions associated with a social network, the cost quickly overwhelms business models. </p>
<h2 id="the-solution"><a class="header" href="#the-solution">The Solution:</a></h2>
<p>The solution necessitates developing a new foundation and infrastructure to secure individual’s data rights and opens innovation beyond the current select few. </p>
<p>The project originated with <a href="https://unfinished.com/">Unfinished</a>, a social impact organization with a network of partners engaged in technology, academia, social impact, and the arts. The first phase of work focused on delivering the social network as core internet functionality.  The Decentralized Social Network, DSNP serves as a public resource entirely independent of financial incentives. Frequency is the second strange of work and unlocks decentralized social networking at scale for the first time.</p>
<p>Frequency builds on blockchain technology to enable users to interact in a public digital space and retain agency over their data. 
A public social graph disconnects financial incentivization completely, establishing an essential foundation for the future of social networks. 
Frequency changes the way blockchain transactions are priced to leverage a network scale suitable for social networking. 
This approach allows technology to be cost-efficiently used for a new range of high-frequency, massive-scale decentralized apps and services.</p>

<h2 id="scalability"><a class="header" href="#scalability">Scalability:</a></h2>
<p>Building Frequency as a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> parachain offers a solution to the challenge of scaling a social networking platform. 
Polkadot's fixed price consensus combined with the relay chain and parachain infrastructures offer capability to manage costs more effectively than other blockchain ecosystems. </p>
<p>Frequency addresses scalability primarily through batching and delegation. 
These schemas significantly reduce the number of transactions the main blockchain needs to verify and record, which in turn speeds up the processing time of the remaining transactions.</p>

<h2 id="account"><a class="header" href="#account">Account</a></h2>
<p>Frequency has two types of accounts — Token Accounts and Message Source Accounts
(see below).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Account ID</code> — A public key that could be a Token Account and/or associated with an MSA.
Account IDs (aka public keys) may only be associated with one MSA.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-token-account"><a class="header" href="#1-token-account">1. Token Account</a></h3>
<p>Token accounts are accounts that hold the token used on Frequency. Token accounts
are the same as <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-accounts">Polkadot accounts</a>
and accounts on most other parachains. Anyone can
create and use one of these accounts, but they are only active if they have tokens
stored in them. They are identified by the public key from a key pair and they are
secured by storing the private part of the key pair in a wallet.</p>
<h3 id="2-message-source-account-msa"><a class="header" href="#2-message-source-account-msa">2. Message Source Account (MSA)</a></h3>
<p>Message Source Accounts (MSAs) are unique to Frequency and do not interact with tokens.
MSAs have <a href="https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/shorts-one-public-key-is-not-enough/215">one or more associated public keys</a>,
allowing for different keys for devices and separate backup keys. Each key is able to be
revoked and new keys added without breaking any connections because the connections are
recorded using a unique number generated when the MSA is created. A wallet is still
required to store the associated private keys for each public key that controls the MSA.
These MSAs interact with <a href="glossary.html#capacity">Capacity</a> and data on the chain, but unlike
a token account, they do not require Capacity to be active.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MSA ID</code> — The 64-bit unsigned integer identifier associated with an MSA.</li>
<li><code>Registered MSA</code> — An MSA that can allow others to delegate to it. Required for
some types of staking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="actor"><a class="header" href="#actor">Actor</a></h2>
<p>The human(s) behind any single user or service that is either directly or indirectly interacting with Frequency.</p>
<h3 id="bad-actor"><a class="header" href="#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a></h3>
<p>A user intentionally using the application for bad-faith or illegal purposes</p>
<h2 id="announcer"><a class="header" href="#announcer">Announcer</a></h2>
<p>A service that a provider uses to queue individual messages and create message for a Parquet Schema.</p>
<h3 id="batch-message"><a class="header" href="#batch-message">Batch Message</a></h3>
<p>One on-chain message that points to lots of messages from different Message Source Accounts.
In other words, it represents a shorthand that is a logical construct:
off-chain payload reference + more than one MSA referenced as a sender in that off-chain data
(aka a Parquet schema with payload location of IPFS).</p>
<h3 id="provider-msa"><a class="header" href="#provider-msa">Provider MSA</a></h3>
<p>The MSA associated with the Account ID that signs a capacity transaction.</p>
<h2 id="bot"><a class="header" href="#bot">Bot</a></h2>
<p>An automated account, sometimes malicious but often providing some service
(&quot;Hey Alexa, what's the weather?&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="capacity"><a class="header" href="#capacity">Capacity</a></h2>
<p>Ability to do a consistent amount of work on the chain repeatedly into the future.
Capacity received from staking is available for the Provider to use once the
Capacity Epoch after the staking happened.</p>
<p>In Frequency context, Capacity is the ability to send messages every Capacity Epoch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity refills each Capacity Epoch</li>
<li>Capacity is gained through Staking</li>
<li>Capacity can be used for the following actions</li>
<li>Creating an MSA</li>
<li>Adding a Key to an MSA</li>
<li>Adding a Provider to an MSA</li>
<li>Modifying a Delegation Permissions</li>
<li>Sending an on-chain message with a given Schema</li>
<li>Sending a batch message with a given Schema</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="capacity-epoch"><a class="header" href="#capacity-epoch">Capacity Epoch</a></h3>
<p>The Capacity Epoch is the number of blocks before capacity refills. In other words,
it is a number of blocks before you get to reuse your Capacity.</p>
<h2 id="collator"><a class="header" href="#collator">Collator</a></h2>
<p>A Frequency node that generates blocks and submit them to the Relay Chain.</p>
<h2 id="consumer"><a class="header" href="#consumer">Consumer</a></h2>
<p>Someone who reads content from social media</p>
<h2 id="content-identifier-cid"><a class="header" href="#content-identifier-cid">Content Identifier (CID)</a></h2>
<p>Self-describing content-addressed identifiers for distributed systems</p>
<h2 id="delegate-verb-ie-to-delegate"><a class="header" href="#delegate-verb-ie-to-delegate">Delegate (verb, i.e. &quot;to delegate&quot;)</a></h2>
<p>The action of an MSA (the Delegator) delegating to a Provider. A verb only.
<strong>DO NOT</strong> use as a noun!</p>
<h2 id="delegate-noun-ie-a-delegate"><a class="header" href="#delegate-noun-ie-a-delegate"><del>Delegate (noun, i.e. &quot;a delegate&quot;)</del></a></h2>
<p>!! <strong>DO NOT</strong> use as a noun! Confusing due to being spelled the same as the verb and
close to Delegator. Replaced with Provider.</p>
<h2 id="delegator"><a class="header" href="#delegator">Delegator</a></h2>
<p>An <a href="glossary.html#message-source-account-msa">MSA</a> that has granted specific permissions to a Provider.</p>

<p>A registered data structure and the settings around it.</p>
<h2 id="staking"><a class="header" href="#staking">Staking</a></h2>
<p>A stake is an amount of money that a person gives up temporarily when receiving a benefit,
usually to shift some of the risk to the owner of the money. A rental security deposit
is a great example of a stake in everyday life. A renter gives the landlord or rental
company some money, and as long as certain criteria are met, the renter receives that
money back at the end of the agreement. The security deposit helps secure against the
renter breaking the agreement because the renter desires the return of the deposit.</p>
<p>Frequency supports two different types of staking that generate Capacity, each
with a different goal. Both types are a form of network staking which supports the
network as a whole and does not participate in securing the network like validator
staking for example. Network staking connects the market component for the value of
the network, which in part reflects the value of the content flowing through the
network. The risk of loss is not from slashing, but that the token loses value.</p>
<h3 id="1-rewards-capacity-staking-for-users"><a class="header" href="#1-rewards-capacity-staking-for-users">1. Rewards Capacity Staking for Users</a></h3>
<p>Because most users will use capacity from Providers, they do not need Capacity directly.
To encourage users to support services and participate in the chain governance,
Frequency offers Rewards Capacity Staking. Like Maximized Capacity Staking, the
stake generates capacity that the user must direct to a Provider they chose.
However, the Rewards Capacity Staking is much less Capacity for the same amount of
tokens staked. Instead, the user receives a periodic “reward” back to the
Token Account of the stake.</p>
<h3 id="2-maximized-capacity-staking-for-applications-and-services"><a class="header" href="#2-maximized-capacity-staking-for-applications-and-services">2. Maximized Capacity Staking for Applications and Services</a></h3>
<p>The goal of Maximized Capacity Staking is to use tokens as efficiently as possible to
generate the most amount of Capacity that is possible. Providers, like applications
and services, need Capacity to interact with Frequency on behalf of their users.
These companies have many competing needs for their capital and will want to maximize
the Capacity generated for the number of tokens they stake.</p>
<p>The amount of Capacity generated from Maximized Capacity Staking is balanced against
Rewards Capacity Staking to ensure that it is almost always more capital efficient for
an application to choose Maximized Capacity Staking. Because Providers have an amount
of Capacity they need to operate, they care most about gaining the needed Capacity
while regular users don’t need a specific Capacity amount and can opt for the more
useful token earnings instead.</p>

The tombstone is necessary, as distributed data stores use eventual consistency,

<h3 id="transaction-weight"><a class="header" href="#transaction-weight">Transaction Weight</a></h3>
<p>Weight is the term for the blockchain computational cost of an action. Different
actions cost different weights. We also charge more for some actions
for spam or future “free” actions.</p>
<h2 id="unstaking"><a class="header" href="#unstaking">Unstaking</a></h2>
<p>If someone who has staked wants to become liquid again in order to transfer or trade
their tokens, they have to go through what is called a thaw period. This is a time
interval where the tokens are not generating any rewards or Capacity, but cannot yet
be used or transferred from the user’s account. After the thaw period ends,
the user can then use, transfer, or even re-stake their tokens.
Once someone has triggered the unstaking process, the Capacity received for those
tokens is removed at the start of the next Capacity Epoch.</p>
<p>This period is important to allow time for the market to react to any actions that
a user has done. It also encourages longer term commitment and investment.
Unlike some chains, Frequency does not currently have staking time periods.
Unstaking requires an active choice by the owner. The length of the thaw period is
currently expected to be about 7 days, but it is still being finalized and is an
example of something that governance could adjust in the future.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-capacity"><a class="header" href="#what-is-capacity">What is Capacity</a></h2>
<p>Capacity is a value transaction that allows for the ability to send messages or do a consistent amount of work on the chain that continues over time. 
It is a non-transferable resource that acts as an alternative to using FRQCY tokens to perform certain transactions and is managed through a rate-limited continuous stream of transactions.</p>
<h2 id="capacity-epoch-1"><a class="header" href="#capacity-epoch-1">Capacity Epoch</a></h2>
<p>A set amount of Capacity is available each <a href="Basics/Capacity.html#capacity-epoch">Capacity Epoch</a>. 
A Capacity Epoch acts as a cycle and refills Capacity each Capacity Epoch (see below visual) during which one can use any amount of Capacity for transactions/messages. 
An Epoch Period is composed of a set number of approximately 100 blocks and could be adjusted through governance. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generated Capacity:</strong>
The amount of Capacity generated for a Provider from staking FRQCY tokens to the network.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-schema"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-schema">What is a Schema</a></h1>
<p><a href="Basics/Schemas.html#schema">Schemas</a> are registered data structures that define the format and properties of how messages are stored. Messages are stores and parsed by the consumer of the message.
This ensures message correctness, validity, extensibility, and interoperability between services. </p>
<p>Frequency is a data-distribution blockchain and implements schemas to define the flow of data across different channels. 
This allows Frequency to support a variety of message types and enforce communication protocol between network and service participants.</p>
<p>Schemas are immutable. 
Once the schema is created it cannot be changed. 
Schema immutability prevents an overly complicated necessity to evolve and update schema(s), simplifying the process. </p>
<h2 id="schema-registry"><a class="header" href="#schema-registry">Schema Registry</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Schema Registry</code> provides an on-chain repository for schemas, thereby allowing participants of the network to flexibly interact and exchange messages without the challenge of managing different schema types. 
The unique identification of schemas on Frequency is a <code>SchemaId</code> that is set when the schema is created.
A <code>SchemaID</code> ensures there is only one type of schema that exists for a specific format of data. </p>
<h2 id="properties-of-schemas"><a class="header" href="#properties-of-schemas">Properties of Schemas</a></h2>
<h3 id="models"><a class="header" href="#models"><a href="Basics/Schemas.html#on-chain-message">Models</a></a></h3>
<p>Schema Models define the format and structure of the data. 
Frequency currently supports two model formats for data to differentiate between on-chain and off-chain storage. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Parquet Type (Off-Chain):</strong> 
Frequency recommends constrained requirements for Parquet files. 
These highly compressed files are stored by message producers in a decentralized file system such as IPFS and a pointer to that file is stored on the Frequency blockchain.
Other Parquet formats are permitted, but not recommended, as it may exhibit challenges for end users to read the data and would require notification from Providers. 
A read-check validation is currently under development for Parquet files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avro Type (On-Chain):</strong> Frequency implements Apache Avro for all on-chain transaction storage. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data is always accompanied by a schema that allows files to be processed later by any program</p>
<h2 id="payload-location"><a class="header" href="#payload-location"><a href="Basics/Schemas.html#payload">Payload Location</a></a></h2>
<p>Payload Location specifies where the data will be stored: on-chain or off-chain. 
Off-chain messages offer a decentralized encrypted location at a lower transaction price and faster transaction publishing. 
On-chain messages offer increased privacy and security at a higher price point and slower transaction publishing. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Off-Chain:</strong> <a href="Basics/Schemas.html#interplanetary-file-system-ipfs">IPFS</a> is a preferred, decentralized file system that allowed dApps to create a batch of messages and store them in IPFS an off-chain. Only the pointer to the file location is published to Frequency on-chain storage. Public domain data allows any user to obtain file information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="Basics/Schemas.html#on-chain-message"><strong>On-Chain</strong></a>: Utilize a key-value pair (A UniqueID stored against a SchemaID that matches an incoming message) where data is stored in an immutable blockchain database. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional information on <strong>How to Create a Schema</strong> will be released soon.</p>
