# Core Principles of Frequency

Frequency aims to return agency to the user amongst an ecosystem of rampant misinformation, censorship from state and corporate actors, and near monopolies from select players with absolute power over social engagements.
Frequency, as an implementation of DSNP, strives to solve these challenges by reshaping online social interactions.

### Different Classes of Transactions
**Data-Focused Transactions**

Blockchain transactions have primarily been financial in nature, even when they didnâ€™t need to be.
Frequency distinguishes between financial transactions and data-focused transactions.
Financial transactions require extra rigor and additional steps (such as defending against the double-spend attack) that are not necessary in data-focused transactions.
However, Frequency [Messages](./Messages.md) retain other blockchain guarantees such as authenticity and data validation.


### Broadcast as a Key to Decentralization
**Announcements and Metadata**

Traditional web systems are centered around point-to-point communications.
Any information that one wants to transmit to an unknown third party requires a centralized system to compile and then distribute the data to known requestors.
Frequency uses the broadcast nature of the blockchain to provide [Message](./Messages.md) metadata that allows the existence of information to be discovered by anyone.
Thus users, be they creators or consumers, can choose their own tools.
Users may then tune in to the data they want, ensuring user control without losing the power and value of a network.


### Different Economic Structure
**Capacity**

The tremendous volatility of blockchain transaction pricing, while normal for emerging technology, creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty for many businesses trying to build on a blockchain.
Even if costs are low on average, unpredictable price spikes lead to businesses not being able to budget or control their costs.
Frequency uses a staking system for sending messages called [Capacity](../Tokenomics/Capacity.md), designed to shift transactions from an operational expense to closer to a capital expenditure.

### Collaborative Standardization
**Shared Schemas**

Much of the power of blockchain has not been in custom smart contracts, but the ability for those contracts to follow standards.
Common use of custom tokens would not be possible without ERC-20 nor NFTs without EIP-721.
Even once those standards are complete, implementations can be flawed or allow for twisted results.
Frequency enables collaborative standardization instead of individual customization.
Frequency is not a replacement for smart contracts.
However, a large subset of the benefits of smart contracts can be realized through [Schemas](./Schemas.md).
With clear usage data and information structures, Frequency allows users to collaborate faster and iterate on standards in new ways.
