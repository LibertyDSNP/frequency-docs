# Benefits of Delegation

Frequency's implementation of delegation and the Capacity economic system enable a new class of low-friction "coinless users".
Coinless users, as the name suggests, do not need tokens to interact with the blockchain and do not need to cryptographically sign every interaction (such as posting a Message or updating their Social Graph).
Instead, coinless users delegate their needs to a Provider.
Coinless users still have MSA accounts with private keys that maintain control of their user information, identity, and delegations on chain.
While a coinless user might still interact with tokens for other purposes, they are not required to do so.
For more information on Frequency’s economic structure, see the section on [Tokenomics](../Tokenomics/index.md).

Providers and coinless users are critical aspects in building decentralized applications for use cases like social networking that require rapid and massive scaling to a large audience with the lowest possible friction.
Onboarding becomes straightforward and intuitive to users as they do not need to acquire tokens or cryptographically sign every interaction, reducing both socioeconomic and technological barriers to entry.

## Autonomous Users

While the Provider-Delegator relationship has clear benefits, the owner of an MSA can still opt to pay for their own interactions with FRQCY Tokens, and can send their own Messages without delegating to a Provider.
The user’s Control Key must be associated with the user’s MSA and hold tokens in order to pay for these transactions.

Any users that opt to hold tokens may engage in staking, governance, building new Frequency Schemas, and with other systems on Frequency.
