# Data Management

Frequency is designed around the need to enable secure and efficient distribution of high-volume, user-generated data.
This data can be stored directly on each node for critical and frequently accessed items, such as a user's Social Graph TODO: LINK?, or can be stored off-chain, with Frequency serving as a means of discovery and authentication of items such as a userâ€™s post, reply, or reaction.

This section discusses the different types of data management provided by Frequency, and the tradeoffs of using each in terms of high availability, scalability, and throughput.
