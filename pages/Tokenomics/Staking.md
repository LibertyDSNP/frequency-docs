# Staking for Capacity

**Capacity is currently under development - more details will be released soon.**

## Two Types of [Staking](../glossary.md#staking)
Frequency supports two types of staking to generate Capacity - each for a different purpose.
Capacity must be directed to a selected Provider for **both** methods of staking.

### 1. Maximized Capacity Staking
The goal of [Maximized Capacity Staking](../glossary.md#2-maximized-capacity-staking-for-applications-and-services) is to use FRQCY tokens as efficiently as possible to generate the most amount of Capacity possible.
Applications, services, and Providers need Capacity to interact with Frequency on behalf of their users.
The amount of Generated Capacity is balanced against Rewards Capacity Staking to ensure that it is almost always more capital efficient.
Providers need to operate a necessary amount of Capacity to support their delegates.
Regular Users do not require a specific amount of Capacity and can opt for token earning options instead.

### 2. Rewards Capacity Staking
Rewards Capacity Staking generates less Capacity for the same number of tokens staked in Maximized Capacity Staking.
[Most users](../basics/AccountsOverview.md#coinless-users) will use Capacity from Providers.
Frequency offers Rewards Capacity Staking to encourage users to engage in on-chain governance and support services.
The user receives a periodic "reward" back to the Token Account of the stake based on user participation.
This incentivizes users to hold FRQCY tokens to increase decentralization and user participation with the Frequency.
Users can change which Providers they support without unstaking, encouraging applications and Providers to stay aligned with Frequency users.

## Unstaking
Users must go through a "thaw" period for staked FRQCY tokens to become liquid.
A thaw period is a time interval, currently expected to be about 7 days, where tokens are not generating any rewards or Capacity but cannot yet be used or transferred to the userâ€™s account.
After the thaw period has ended, tokens can be used, transferred, or re-staked. Once unstaking has begun, the Capacity received for those tokens is removed at the start of the next Capacity Epoch.
