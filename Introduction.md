# Introduction
Frequency is the first implementation of The Decentralized Social Network Protocol (DSNP) operating as a Polkadot parachain. Frequency enables users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data. It provides scalable message passion as a backbone of new shared protocols that create value through cooperation and user choice. 

Here you can find detailed documentation for Frequency, official implementation specifications, associated specifications, as well as a roadmap and proposals for future extensions.

## Core Ideas

Frequency aims to return agency to the user in a modern ecosystem consisting of rampant misinformation, censorship from state and corporate actors, and near monopolies from select players with absolute power over social engagements. Frequency, as an implementation of DSNP, strives to solve these challenges in reshaping online social interactions.

1. **Different Classes of Transactions**
	* Data Focused Transactions
 
2. **Broadcast as a Key to Decentralization**
	* Announcements and Metadata
	
3. **Different Economic Structure**
	* Capacity
	
4. **Collaborative Standardization**
	* Smart Schemas
 

## The Problem: 

Social networking has wholly transformed digital communication for the modern age. Yet over the last 10 years, the industry has become dominated by a handful of global private companies, growing rich off the data of their users. These data repositories sparked significant user insights which soon grew into a web of manipulation, exploitation, and polarization. The evolution of these secrative agencies made clear that the social infrastructure needed to change and return agency back to the users. 


## The Solution:

The solution necessitates developing a new foundation and infrastructure to secure individual’s data rights and opens innovation beyond the current select few. Frequency builds on blockchain technology to enable users to interact in a public digital space and retain agency over their data. A public social graph disconnects financial incentivization completely, establishing an essential foundation for the future of social networks. We change the way blockchain transactions are priced to leverage a network scale suitable for social networking. This approach makes decentralized social networks production-ready for the first time.

## Scalability:

Building Frequency as a [Polkadot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started) parachain offers an elegant solution to the challenge of scaling a social networking platform. Polkadot’s fixed price consensus combined with the relay chain and parachian infrastructures offer capability to manage costs more effectively than other blockchain ecosystems. 

Frequency addresses scalability primarily through batching and delegation. These schemas significantly reduce the number of transactions the main blockchain needs to verify and record, which in turn speeds up the processing time of the remaining transactions.

## Lack of Financial Incentive for dApps: 

Removal of financial incentive is a key pillar of DSNP and Frequency’s implementation framework. 

Implemetaion elements for this concept are currently under development.
