# Collator Roll Out Plan

Frequency currently operates using “invulnerable” Collators, however, expect to switch to open Collators sometime in 2023.

More Collators are not necessarily better, as they can slow the network; we aim to maintain network stability and operation while increasing decentralization and openness as quickly as possible. To accomplish this, we have three key initiatives to execute:

1. Initialization: Select Organizations
2. Expansion and Testing: Open Applications
3. Public Collators: Anyone can register as a Collator candidate

**Initialization**

* Integrates Collators from select organizations
* Organizations guarantee public transparency and access to all non-malicious transactions to the block
* Commit to keeping up with client updates to enable chain evolution

Collators will receive FRQCY token grants to assist with operational costs distributed through the genesis and governance

**Expansion and Testing**

* Collator applications will be open to anyone
* Collators will form the foundation of the public Collator set
* Collators will utilize the same token grant system.

This phase will test the incentivization as Frequency progresses to fully public Collators. 

**Public Collators**

* Collators are selected based on bond, governance support, and uptime that will be developed
* Progression highly depends on the safety and security of the network

Post completion, Frequency plans to continue running Collators as well, to do our part to ensure the guarantees do state and access.
