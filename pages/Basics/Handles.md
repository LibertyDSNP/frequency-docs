#Handles

##What are User Handles?
User Handles allow Frequency Users to select names for themselves in the Frequency Nework.  The User Handle has two parts: the Base (the part of the handle the User selects for themself) followed by a dot and then the Suffix (a numerical code assigned by Frequency.  So in the case where Alice chose the Base name AliceInWonderland, her User Handle might read AliceInWonderland.356 with the suffix 356 assigned by Frequency.  User Handles are tied to Unique IDs
