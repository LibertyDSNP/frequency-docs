# Decentralization Roadmap

Frequency currently operates using "invulnerable" Collators, and expects to switch to open Collators sometime in 2023.

More Collators are not necessarily better, as they can slow the network; Frequency aims to maintain network stability and operation while increasing decentralization and openness as quickly as possible.
To accomplish this, Frequency has three key initiatives to execute:

1. Initialization: Select Organizations
2. Expansion and Testing: Open Applications
3. Public Collators: Anyone can register as a Collator candidate

## Initialization (Current)

* Integrates Collators from select organizations
* Organizations guarantee public transparency and access to all non-malicious transactions to the block
* Commits to keeping up with client updates to enable chain evolution

Collators will receive FRQCY token grants to assist with operational costs distributed through the genesis and governance.

## Expansion and Testing

* Collator applications will be open to anyone.
* Collators will form the foundation of the public Collator set.
* Collators will utilize the same token grant system.

This phase will test the incentivization as Frequency progresses to fully public Collators.Â 

## Public Collators

* Collators are selected based on bond, governance support, and uptime that will be developed
* Progression highly depends on the safety and security of the network

Post completion, Frequency plans to continue running Collators as well to ensure the guarantees to state and access.
