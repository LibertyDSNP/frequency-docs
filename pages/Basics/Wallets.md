[Open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/frequency-docs/issues/new/choose) and let us know!

- [Polkadot JS Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
- (Coming Soon) [Parity Signer](https://www.parity.io/technologies/signer/)

Most Polkadot ecosystem wallets can be configured for Frequency as well. See [Polkadot's Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-wallets) for these additional wallets.
