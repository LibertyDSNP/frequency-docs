# How to Create a Message Source Account

You can create a Message Service Account in one of two ways:

1. [Create a Token Account](LibertyDSNP/frequency-docs/pages/HowTo/CreateTokenAccount.md) and submit a transaction for creating an MSA, or
2. Delegate authority to another MSA.

*Note: Because of these two ways of creating an MSA, it should be clear that keypairs assigned to an MSAId do not imply that these keys are associated to a token account.  An MSA can exist independently of a Token Account.*
