# Collator Decentralization Roadmap

Frequency currently operates using "invulnerable" Collators.
These Collators are not removed for lack of block production and do not require a stake or bond to operate.

Frequency aims to maintain network stability and operation while increasing decentralization and openness as quickly as possible.
To accomplish this, there are three key phases:

1. Initialization: Select Organizations.
2. Expansion and Testing: Open Applications.
3. Public Collators: Open Registration.

## Initialization (Current)

- Collators from select organizations.
- Organizations guarantee public transparency and will add all non-malicious transactions to the block.
- Organizations commit to keeping up with client updates to enable chain evolution.

## Expansion and Testing

- Collator applications will be open to anyone.
- Accepted applicants will form the foundation of the public Collator set.

This phase will test the incentivization as Frequency progresses to fully public Collators.

## Public Collators

- Collators are selected based on bond, governance support, and uptime that will be developed.
- Progression into this phase depends on the safety and security of the network.
