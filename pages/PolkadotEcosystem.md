## What is a Polkadot Parachain?

A Parachain is a blockchain that works within the confines of the Polkadot host Relay Chain, running in parallel as a "parallelized chain".

The main responsibility of the Relay Chain is to coordinate parachains as a whole.
Parachains benefit from the pooled security, thought-through governance, and overall scalability generated via the Relay Chain.

Parachains operate as layer-1 blockchains that run parallel to the Polkadot Relay Chain. Parachains can parallelize transaction processing and utilize other benefits from the Polkadot blockchain including scalability, solidly-staked security, and communication (via the XCM format) with other parachains.

## Why is Frequency a Parachain?

Frequency is a Polkadot Parachain dedicated to decentralized social media.
Balancing blockchain-based incentive models with the massive scale needed to support a social network is challenging.
However, Polkadot’s model (a Relay Chain with connected Parachains) offers a fixed price consensus, making it ideal for a highly scalable operation.

The ability to alter the pricing structure of blockchain transactions served as an essential consideration in developing Frequency as a Polkadot Parachain.

Parachains don’t pay a separate fee for each block that gets validated. Rather, Parachains pay via 
[Parachain leases](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-auction#parachain-lease-extension) which are settled via funds gathered from slot auctions and the Polkadot community.

As a Parachain, Frequency accomplishes several functionality components essential for its development:

1. Different Classes of Transactions
2. Broadcast as a Key to Decentralization
3. Different Economic Structures
4. Collaborative Standardization
