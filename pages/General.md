## The Problem

Social networking has wholly transformed digital communication for the modern age.
Unfortunately, the social networking industry is currently dominated by a handful of global private companies growing rich off the data of their users.
These data repositories, that were ceaselessly mined for significant user insights, ultimately grew into a web of manipulation, exploitation, and polarization.
The evolution of these secretive agencies made clear that the social infrastructure needed to change and return agency back to the users.

Yet there are significant challenges when blockchain technology is applied to the high-volume, low-value transactions associated with a social network, as the cost can quickly overwhelm business models.

## The Solution

Frequency builds on blockchain technology to enable users to interact in a public digital space while retaining agency over their data.
Frequency supports the [DSNP](https://dsnp.org) public social graph which completely disconnects financial incentivization from the social graph, establishing an essential foundation for the future of social networks.  Frequency changes the unit economics of blockchain transactions to leverage a network scale suitable for a new range of massively scaled decentralized apps and services. The first use case for Frequency is with the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol, an open, web3 protocol for ethical, economical, and scalable decentralized social media applications.

## Scalability

Building Frequency as a Polkadot parachain offers a solution to the challenge of scaling a social networking platform.  Frequency addresses scalability via The Frequency Triangle--a unique combination of three unique economic models with manual and automatic balance mechanisms in a novel ecosystem that can provide blockchain applications that are both economical and ethical at scale.

The Delegation Model, The Capacity Staking Model, and The Data Transaction Model.
