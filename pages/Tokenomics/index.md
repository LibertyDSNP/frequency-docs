# Tokenomics

Frequency's economic model has been designed to optimize for the scalability concerns associated with social networking, specifically data focused transactions centered around new Message publishing versus updates to existing data.
Like most blockchains, Frequency enables transaction fees to be paid in its native token: Mainnet utilizes a utility token called FRQCY, while on Testnet, the token is denoted as XRQCY.
In addition to tokens, Frequency also utilizes a system of impermanent Capacity, a renewing stake-based alternative that allows Providers to perform certain types of transactions.

This section covers the design of the Frequency Incentive Model and key cryptoeconomic elements such as token distribution and the inflation system.
The Frequency Incentive Model focuses on the three core actors: Collator Incentives, Provider Incentives, and User Incentives.
